A quantum classifier based on the paper 
"circuit-centric quantum classifier", Maria Schuld, Alex Bocharov, Krysta Svore and Nathan Wiebe. Aims to test the feasibiliy of the model.

This code is based on classical simulation rather than using real quantum computers. I hope one day I can implement it on IBM's Quantum Experience.

Status: unfinished.
