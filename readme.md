A quantum classifier based on the paper 

"circuit-centric quantum classifier", Maria Schuld, Alex Bocharov, Krysta Svore and Nathan Wiebe. https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.00633

Aims to use mnist dataset to test the feasibiliy of the model.

This code is based on classical simulation rather than using real quantum computers. I hope one day I can implement it on IBM's Quantum Experience ^o^ ~

Status: unfinished.
